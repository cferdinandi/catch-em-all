# Feature Wishlist

There are a handful of features and improvements I'd love to add this project...

- [ ] Manual Dark Mode/Light Mode controls (currently [automatic based on OS settings](./docs/decisions.md#dark-mode))
- [ ] The ability to "Favorite" a Pokemon, and view a list of Favorites on a dedicated page
- [ ] A complete _Evolution Tree_ for each Pokemon (requires multiple API calls)
